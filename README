DLogger

An extended Debug / Tracing library for use for iPhone application development.

Features:
- Logging is compiled out for non-DEBUG builds
- Per-class logging control
- Auto-logging of Class, Function and Line Number
- Convenience calls for tracing vs. logging
- Variable-length argument lists in log messages

Usage:
Project includes three build targets
- dlogger-simulator: logging library for use with simulator-targetted applications
- dlogger-device: logging library for use with device-targetted applications
- Make All: convenience target for building both libraries and merging them into a single architecture-independant library

Building:
Build the 'Make All' target.
